Following is an abbreviated memory map of PCI-LTC/RDR board DPRAM
registers as viewed from the PCI bus (application software)  side
of  things.  Only registers and bits which are pertinent to  this
particular application are listed.  All other registers and  bits
are reserved.  Reading or writing reserved registers or bits  may
lead  to  unpredictable results, including damage  to  the  board
(because it is an in-circuit programmable device) which  requires
that  the  board be returned to the factory  for  repairs.   When
writing  to bit mapped registers, be sure to write zeroes to  any
reserved bits (the default state - won't hurt anything).   Please
call us if you have any questions or find any problems:
